    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Everyone has their simple af sandwich that they grew up eating throughout their childhood and you'll still eat it as an adult. We had our signature sandwich: some deli meat, some sliced cheese, some spread, nothing too fancy. For me, it was a salami and cheese sandwich. Again, not fancy at all.</p>

    <p>Very simple, takes like 5 seconds to do, but why not just share my favorite childhood sandwich? Let's bring on the nostalgia!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices of bread, toasted</li>
        <li>Mayo</li>
        <li>Extra Sharp Cheddar Cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>Salami straight from the deli</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Spread your mayo on both slices of bread, one side each.</li>
        <li>Assemble your cheese and salami together in between the bread.</li>
        <li>Eat and feel like you're enjoying your lunch on a Saturday afternoon in 1993.</li>
    </ol>
