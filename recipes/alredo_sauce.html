    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Alfredo sauce is honestly so much better homemade than store bought. It doesn't take that much effort or break the bank.</p>

    <p>Here are the directions on how I make my homemade alfredo sauce.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp butter, unsalted</li>
        <li>2 tbsp cream cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 cup parmesean cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic (or how many you want, idgaf</li>
        <li>Half a bag of spinach, it's all gonna shrink anyway</li>
        <li>Italian seasoning, to taste</li>
        <li>Cayenne and/or Cajun seasoning, to taste</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 lemon for lemon juice and zest</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In medium low heat, melt butter and saute garlic in it until transculsent.</li>
        <li>Stir in cream cheese until melted.</li>
        <li>Add heavy cream, Italian seasonin, cayenne and/or Cajun seasoning, salt, pepper and spinach. Stir until spinach is wilted.</li>
        <li>Stir in parmesean cheese and let simmer until it is at the consistency you desire. If it's too thick, add in small bits of heavy cream at a time. Stir occassionally to avoid the dairy to boil over. </li>
        <li>Squeeze in lemon juice and stir throughout to keep from curdling.</li>
        <li>Taste test the whole way. Once you are statisfied with the taste and the consistency, it's done!</li>
